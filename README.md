# Building-information-and-age-records-2024
## Introduction
Hong Kong's buildings account for about 90% of the city's electricity use. Over 50% of our carbon emissions are attributable to generating electricity for our buildings. Thus, achieving energy saving in the building sectors is the primary target for the long-term. Since 21 September 2012, the Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance (BEEO) came into full operation by mandating the specified requirements to comply with the Building Energy Code (BEC) in respect of regulating the minimum energy efficiency standards of the design of building services installations in newly constructed buildings and major retrofitting works in existing buildings and also requiring owners of commercial buildings to conduct energy audit according to the Energy Audit Code (EAC). 

The objective of this analysis on building information and age records is to provide a comprehensive overview of Hong Kong's buildings and their age distribution. This information is instrumental in informing the development of advanced ordinances that align with the ongoing goals of Hong Kong's Climate Action Plan 2050.

## Buildings Energy Efficiency Ordinance (BEEO)
The three (3) key requirements of the BEEO:
1. The developers or building owners of newly constructed buildings should ensure that the four (4) key types of building services installation including air-conditioning installation, lighting installation, electrical installation and lift and escalator installation comply with the design standards of the Code of Practice for Energy Efficiency of Building Services Installation (BEC).
2. The responsible persons such as owners, tenants or occupiers in buildings should ensure that the four (4) key types of building services installation therein comply with the design standards of the BEC when undergoing “major retrofitting works”.
3. The owners of commercial buildings including the commercial portions of composite buildings like shopping malls under residential storeys should carry out energy audit for the four (4) key types of Central Building Services Installation therein in accordance with the Code of Practice for Building Energy Audit (EAC) once every ten (10) years.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis comes from a database established by the Building Department of HKSAR. It includes information such as address, building type, building usage, block ID, occupation permit date and occupation permit number of private buildings. This database undergoes updates on an annual basis.
